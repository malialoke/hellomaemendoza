      title: "I build efficient workflows and optimize processes.",
      description:
        "Even the best-designed processes accumulate friction over time. Extra steps, redundant reviews, and repetitive tasks slow development timelines. I pinpoint the issues causing the drag and build systems that eliminate it. Sometimes this involves streamlining workflows. In other cases, it might involve developing an AI-assisted process that lets the team focus on parts that actually require thinking. The key is to focus on making the process serve the work, not the other way around.",

        "Process optimization",
        "AI-assisted efficiencies",
        "Workflow documentation",

    {
      number: "02",
      title: "I bring clarity to complex content.",
      description:
        "Every project starts with a mess of requirements: state standards, accessibility guidelines, client style guides, reading level targets. I sort through all of it to figure out what the content actually needs to do and who it needs to reach. From there, I build out courses, lessons, and activities that hit the learning objectives without losing the students along the way. The scaffolding matters as much as the content itself.",
      examples: [
        "Instructional design",
        "Content development",
        "Standards alignment",
      ],
    },
    {
      number: "03",
      title: "I craft content tailored to specific contexts and audiences.",
      description:
        "Content needs vary wildly from project to project. A kindergarten activity has different demands than a standards alignment justification or a B2B proposal bid. Over the past decade, I've written for K-12 Publishing and EdTech companies, developed technical and process documentation, and crafted business proposals with bespoke samples. That breadth means I can step into most content projects seamlessly.",
      examples: ["K-12 ELA & Social Studies", "Technical writing", "Proposals and bespoke samples"],
    },
    {
      number: "04",
      title: "I adjust language to meet learners where they are.",
      description:
        "Sometimes the content is technically correct, but inaccessible to the audience. Expert-written content often reads like it was written for other experts. A PhD wrote it like a dissertation but it needs to be understandable to eighth grade English Language Learners. I bridge the gap by adjusting the grammar and diction to simplify the language without losing the content depth.",
      examples: [
        "Language leveling",
        "Content remediation",
        "Learner-centered design",
      ],
    },
    {
      number: "05",
      title: "I use human subject matter expertise to review and verify.",
      description:
        "AI-generated content is fast, but it's not reliable without human oversight. LLMs hallucinate facts, miss context, and apply terminology inconsistently. I catch what the models get wrong and what other reviewers miss. My 10+ year background in K-12 ELA and Social Studies allows me to identify and fix common issues and factual errors, both of the human and generative AI variety.",
